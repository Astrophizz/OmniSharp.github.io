### Welcome to OmniSharp...for your editor!
![Look at all those editor icons!](images/icons.png?raw=true)

OmniSharp is a family of Open Source projects, each with one goal - To enable great .NET development in YOUR editor of choice.

It's fun to say Cross Platform .NET. But is it really possible? Is it reasonable for someone to develop .NET without Visual Studio and Windows? 

Is it fun to do .NET on a Mac in Sublime? Ubuntu and Emacs? Windows and Atom?

### We say yes.
We unapologetically love .NET. We love C# and ASP.NET. We also love Sublime, Atom, Emacs, Vim and Brackets.

We create ASP.NET apps on Ubuntu and deploy to Azure. We make ASP.NET services from our Macs and deploy to Linux

And we do all this while still getting to use useful features like Intellisense (not just Autocomplete), Add Reference, Format Document, and lots more.

### Here's how to get started
